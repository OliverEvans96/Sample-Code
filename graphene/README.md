## Simple LAMMPS demonstration using Graphene

Some of my professors who study graphene expressed an interest in learning more about LAMMPS, so I prepared some simple simulation scenarios to demonstrate the basics of LAMMPS. I generated the input files using Python. I also took the opportunity to attempt object orientation in Python, which proved to simplify the use of the code considerably, making it very straightforward to combine simple graphene geometries to create complex scenes to be inputted into LAMMPS.
