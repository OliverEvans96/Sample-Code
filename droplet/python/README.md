### Python scripts for droplet project

flowfield.py generates quiver plots to visualize velocity over time for a droplet.

comparison.ipynb gives a big-picture overview of relevant quantities over a variety of simulations.

Spherical Monolayer Model.ipynb demonstrates that monolayer radius is linear in log-log space, and performs least squares fitting to derive a predictive formula for spreading of droplets of similar sizes.
