### C++ scripts for droplet project

CircleFitClass.cpp/h performs circle fitting given points using ROOT.

Quiver.cpp/h creates simple vector field plots using ROOT.

sortWaters.cpp sorts atoms by index for many timesteps.

calculations_centered.cpp runs all sorts of calculations related to velocity, orientation, and position of atoms. This was one of my first big codes cut me some slack here. It was a few years ago.

substrateDensity.cpp calculates the average density of sapphire as a function of height, useful for determining the position of the substrate.

FieldViz.cpp/h generates Line Integral Convolution plots of velocity data for water. I started with code written by Zhanping Liu, and expanded considerably.
