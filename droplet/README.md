## Molecular Dynamics Simulation to Analyze Nanodroplet Spreading Dynamics 

We ran several simulations of water droplets on the order of 10nm in diameter spreading on sapphire surfaces using LAMMPS.
Using histogram binning and curve fitting, we determine the boundary of the water droplet.
In particular, we study how the radius evolves over time, as well as the radius of a thin film we refer to as the "monolayer" which spreads considerably faster and farther than the bulk of the droplet.

Initial data analysis is performed using the C++ package called ROOT, while visualization and post-processing analysis is performed using Python and Jupyter.
